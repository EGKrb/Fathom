# Changelog

All notable changes to Fathom are documented here. Fathom is built on
[x64dbg](https://github.com/x64dbg/x64dbg) (GPL-3.0) and tracks its `development`
branch; this changelog covers Fathom's own additions and branding.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/).

## [1.1.0] - 2026-10-29

### Added
- **TraceExport** — two new output formats, the text traces of the IDA Pro
  trace explorers [Tenet](https://github.com/gaasedelen/tenet) (`tenet`, x86
  and x64) and [Frinet](https://github.com/synacktiv/frinet) (`frinet`, x64,
  chosen automatically for `.tenet` files, with an optional ASLR `slide`
  argument). pybridge's `export_trace()` accepts them, plus a `slide`.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-10-29

First release under the Fathom name.

### Added
- **HvKdFusion** — Hyper-V kernel debugging and memory forensics, driven from
  the command bar (`hvkd`, `hvkd.log`, `hvkd.check`, `wineye`) and from a
  dockable **HvKdFusion GUI tab** in the debugger (VM selector, component
  readiness, process explorer → modules / VADs / handles, Dump / Debug / Mount).
- **wineye** — a native-Windows, passive, WinDbg-style memory REPL on
  MemProcFS's `vmm.dll` (no WSL, no Dokany), with **server modes**
  `--serve mcp | dap | gdb` (MCP for AI/agent clients, Debug Adapter Protocol,
  and GDB Remote Serial Protocol).
- **TraceExport** — execution traces to JSON / CSV.
- **pybridge** — drive the debugger from Python, with headless templates.
- **ExtraCmds** plugin — `.init` / `.save` / `scylla_hide.*`, a minidump viewer,
  and the HvKdFusion commands.
- Bundled **ScyllaHide** and **xAnalyzer**; **OllyDumpEx** / **PE-sieve**
  installable with SHA-256 verification.

### Changed
- **Branding**: launcher renamed to `Fathom.exe` with its own icon; main-window
  title and version resource set to **Fathom**. The engine executables and DLLs
  keep their x64dbg names (plugins and the SDK depend on them).

### Fixed
- Minidump viewer build (`CMAKE_SYSTEM_VERSION`) on hosts reporting 6.2.9200.
